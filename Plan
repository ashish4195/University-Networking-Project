🌐 Overview/Planning
University has two campuses:
•	Main Campus with 3 buildings (A, B, C)
•	Smaller Campus with the Faculty of Health and Sciences
Each department/faculty must be on a separate IP network using VLANs, with RIPv2 for routing and DHCP for dynamic IP assignment in Building A.

🧱 Network Topology Plan
🏢 Main Campus
1. Building A
•	Departments: Management, HR, Finance (Admin Staff) + Faculty of Business
•	VLANs:
  •	VLAN 10: Management
  •	VLAN 20: HR
  •	VLAN 30: Finance
  •	VLAN 40: Faculty of Business
•	DHCP: Router-based DHCP for all VLANs in this building

2. Building B
•	Faculties: Engineering/Computing, Art & Design
•	VLANs:
  •	VLAN 50: Engineering/Computing
  •	VLAN 60: Art & Design

3. Building C
•	Students' Labs + IT Department
•	VLANs:
  •	VLAN 70: Student Labs
  •	VLAN 80: IT Department
•	Servers:
  •	Web Server
  •	FTP Server
  •	DNS Server (optional)

🌩️ Cloud
•	External Email Server (reachable via static route)

🏥 Smaller Campus
•	Faculty of Health and Sciences
  •	VLAN 90: Staff
  •	VLAN 100: Student Labs

🔧 Configuration Requirements
🛠️ Core Devices
•	Routers: 2 (one per campus)
•	Switches: Layer 3 switch in Building A; Layer 2 switches in other buildings
•	Routing: RIPv2 between routers; static route to cloud email server
•	DHCP: Enabled on router in Building A, B, C for VLANs 10–80
•	DHCP: Enabled on router in Small Campus for VLANs 90-100

🔐 Security & VLAN Setup
•	Assign ports to VLANs
•	Configure trunk links between switches
•	Set native VLANs consistently
•	Enable port security (optional)
